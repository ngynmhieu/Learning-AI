"""Storage client — a thin wrapper around Supabase Storage for one bucket.

Built once during the app lifespan with the **service-role** key (bypasses Storage
RLS, so it may write under any user's prefix on their behalf — used only for the
`read` module's scrape-import path, which is the one place bytes flow through the
backend). `storage3`'s client is synchronous, so every call runs in a threadpool to
avoid blocking the event loop (same pattern as `AuthService.verify`).

# Frontend Guideline Plan

This frontend should use a hybrid structure:

- **Modular monolith** for top-level business boundaries.
- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** inside each module to organize UI and logic.

The goal is to keep the app easy to grow, easy to test, and easy to assign to teams without turning the codebase into a flat component dump.

## Core Rules

1. **Pages compose, they do not own everything.**
   - A page should assemble widgets and features.
   - It should not contain all business logic.

2. **Features contain user actions and workflows.**
   - Examples: login, search, add-to-cart, submit-order.
   - A feature can coordinate state, validation, and API calls for one action.

3. **Entities contain business concepts.**
   - Examples: user, product, order, invoice.
   - Keep domain types, mappers, selectors, and small entity-specific helpers here.

4. **Shared contains only reusable cross-cutting code.**
   - UI primitives, API client, utilities, constants, hooks, and configuration.
   - Shared code must not depend on business modules.

5. **Modules are business boundaries.**
   - Example modules: auth, catalog, orders, billing, analytics.
   - Modules should be isolated and expose only public APIs.

6. **UI and logic are separated.**
   - UI components should focus on rendering.
   - Logic should live in features, entities, or services.

7. **Cross-module imports should be limited.**
   - Import from another module only through its public API.
   - Avoid deep imports into internal folders.

8. **All colors must be defined in `index.css` and reused via CSS variables.**
   - Never use raw color codes (hex, rgb, oklch) directly in components.
   - Define all colors as CSS variables in `index.css` (e.g. `--color-primary: #7B3F1E`).
   - In components, reference them via Tailwind's arbitrary property syntax or CSS: `text-[var(--color-primary)]`.
   - If a new color is needed, add it to `index.css` first, then reuse the variable.

10. **Use proportional units only — never fixed pixel values.**
   - Use `rem`, `em`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`, `svh`, `fr`, or Tailwind's spacing scale (which is rem-based) for all sizing.
   - Never use `px` for widths, heights, margins, paddings, font sizes, or positions.
   - Exception: borders and outlines (`border-2`, `border`) may use `px` as they are decorative and do not affect layout flow.
   - This ensures the UI scales correctly across screen sizes and respects user font preferences.

9. **Imports must go through the module's public API, not deep into its folder.**
   - Every folder that exposes components must have an `index.ts` that re-exports them.
   - Consumers import from the folder level, not the file level.
   - Correct: `import { GradientBackground } from "@/shared/ui"`
   - Incorrect: `import { GradientBackground } from "@/shared/ui/GradientBackground"`

## Loading States

A page or widget's **initial data fetch** — the request that gates whether its
primary content can render at all (page load, opening a detail view, a
grid/list's first fetch) — must show `LoadingDialog` from `shared/ui` with
`fullScreen={false}`, not bare text (`<p>Loading…</p>`) or a spinner. It renders
the running-owl mascot card centered in whatever contains it, so it fills just
that page/section instead of the whole viewport (the sidebar and rest of the
app stay visible and interactive).

```tsx
// correct — the section that would otherwise render nothing yet
if (!detail) return <LoadingDialog fullScreen={false} message="Fetching your manga…" />;

// wrong — plain text for a load that gates real content
if (!detail) return <p className="...">Loading…</p>;
```

`fullScreen` (the default, `true`) stays reserved for cases where nothing is
rendered behind it yet: the post-login boot gate and the `<Suspense>` fallback
for lazily-loaded route chunks in `app/router/index.tsx`.

### Gate at the page level, not nested below other chrome

The dialog must appear **before any element of the page** — a header, back
button, or action bar must not render above/around it while the data is still
loading. Read the loading state (or whatever hook/context provides it) in the
page component itself and early-return the dialog there, before the page's own
markup. Don't push the check down into a child widget that only replaces its
own slot, leaving the header/chrome visible around a lone loading card.

```tsx
// correct — LectorLibraryPage reads the same state MangaGrid would have,
// and gates before its header renders at all
export function LectorLibraryPage() {
  const { mangas, loading, error } = useReadLibrary();

  if (loading && mangas.length === 0) {
    return <LoadingDialog fullScreen={false} message="Fetching your library…" />;
  }
  if (error) return <p className="...">Couldn't load your library.</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <header>...</header>
      <MangaGrid />
    </div>
  );
}

// wrong — header/toolbar always renders; only MangaGrid's own slot loads
export function LectorLibraryPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>...</header>
      <MangaGrid /> {/* shows the dialog internally, chrome above it is already visible */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

If a widget used to own that check itself (e.g. `MangaGrid` reading
`useReadLibrary()`'s `loading`/`error`), remove it once the parent page gates
on the same state — the widget only mounts after the page has already decided
the data is ready, so a duplicate check there is unreachable dead code.

**Exceptions** — keep plain text/inline spinners for:
- Small in-place checks inside an already-visible panel (e.g. fetching a page
  count inside an open form) — the mascot card is sized for a page/section, not
  a compact panel.
- Narrow, fixed-width regions like the sidebar's conversation list — there's
  no room for a `h-36 w-36` card.
- Busy states for a user-initiated action already in flight (a button reading
  "Creating…"/"Uploading…" while disabled) — that's action feedback, not a
  page waiting to exist.

## Recommended Folder Structure

```txt
frontend/src/
  app/
    layouts/        ← AppLayout (header + Outlet), Header, other global layout shells
    router/         ← createBrowserRouter config; pages are registered here, not imported by layouts
    providers/      ← React context providers, theme wrappers, etc.
    styles/         ← global CSS, keyframes, Tailwind base overrides
  shared/
    api/            ← endpoint callers only, one file per backend domain (no client/SDK creation)
    lib/            ← generic infra: SDK clients, transport wrappers, hooks/utilities (no business logic)
    ui/             ← design system primitives (Button, Input, Modal…)
    config/         ← environment variables, feature flags
    assets/         ← global icons, logos, fonts
  modules/
    auth/
      pages/
      widgets/
      features/
      entities/
      shared/       ← module-internal reusable code (not exposed app-wide)
    catalog/
      pages/
      widgets/
      features/
      entities/
      shared/
    orders/
      pages/
      widgets/
      features/
      entities/
      shared/
```

## Folder Responsibilities

### `app/`
This is the application shell.

Main activities:
- Bootstrap providers
- Configure routing — `router/` holds `createBrowserRouter`; pages slot in as children of layout routes
- Define global layout shells — `layouts/` holds `AppLayout` (header + `<Outlet />`), `Header`, and any future layout variants
- Register global styles
- Initialize app-wide state or theme
- Wire global error boundaries

Rules:
- Layout components render `<Outlet />`, they do not import pages directly
- Pages are registered only in the router config, never imported by `AppLayout` or `Header`
- Adding a new page = one new route entry in `router/index.tsx`, nothing else changes

Use `app/` for things that must exist before the rest of the UI works.

### `shared/`
This is the global reusable layer.

Main activities:
- Design system components like button, input, modal, table
- Cross-cutting endpoint callers (`api/`) and the networking infra they use (`lib/`)
- Utility functions and constants
- Global configuration and environment access
- Generic hooks that are not business-specific
- Common assets such as icons or logos

Use `shared/` only for code that is truly reusable across the whole app.

#### Networking layers (`api` vs `lib` vs `config`)

`shared/` networking code is split by **what layer it is**, not by feature name. One
question decides where a file goes:

| The file… | Goes in | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| creates a client/SDK instance, or wraps raw transport | `shared/lib/` | `supabase.ts` (the `createClient` singleton), `http.ts` (`fetchWithToken` — adds the session token to any request), `storage.ts` (Supabase Storage wrapper — `uploadToBucket`, `createSignedUrls`) |
| names specific backend routes / payload shapes (an endpoint caller) **and is reused by more than one module** | `shared/api/`, **one file per backend domain** | `chat.ts` |
| names specific backend routes but is used by **only one module** | that module (`modules/<m>/...`), **not** `shared/api` | auth's `/auth/me` caller → `modules/auth/features/sync-profile/` |
| reads an environment variable | `shared/config/` | `env.ts` |

Rules:

- **`shared/api/` holds endpoint callers only** — never client or SDK creation. Each file
  groups the calls for one backend domain (`chat.ts`, not a catch-all `api.ts`).
- **`shared/lib/` holds the plumbing** those callers use: the SDK client instance and the
  base transport wrapper. (`lib/` also keeps its existing role for generic hooks/utilities.)
- Dependency direction is one-way: **`api → lib → config`**. An endpoint caller uses the
  transport; the transport uses the client; the client reads config. Nothing flows back up,
  and `api`/`lib` never import a business module.
- **Module-specific** endpoints live in that module (`modules/<m>/...`), not in `shared/api`.
  A caller only belongs in `shared/api` when it is genuinely reused across modules.

#### All backend requests must carry the session token

Every backend route (chat, auth, and any future route) requires a signed-in user.
Use `fetchWithToken` from `shared/lib` instead of bare `fetch` for **all** backend calls.
`fetchWithToken` reads the current Supabase session and attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` automatically — callers do not handle the token themselves.

```ts
// correct — token is attached automatically
import { fetchWithToken } from "@/shared/lib";
const res = await fetchWithToken("/some-route", { method: "POST", body: ... });

// wrong — backend will reject with 401
const res = await fetch("/some-route", { method: "POST", body: ... });
```

Never import `supabase` directly in a feature or entity just to read the session token — that
belongs in `shared/lib/http.ts`. Features call `fetchWithToken`; the token plumbing stays in one place.

#### Exception: large media goes directly to Supabase Storage, not the backend

`fetchWithToken` is for **backend routes** (metadata, JSON). **Binary media** — image
files in the `read` module — does **not** flow through the backend; the frontend
uploads files and mints read URLs **directly against Supabase Storage**, which is faster
(CDN) and avoids proxying megabytes through FastAPI. This still rides the **same
authenticated Supabase session** (Storage RLS sees the logged-in user), so it is not an
auth bypass — only a different transport for bytes.

Keep that access in one place too: a thin `shared/lib/storage.ts` wrapper
(`uploadToBucket`, `createSignedUrls`) is the **only** sanctioned spot to touch the
Supabase client for Storage — features/entities call the wrapper, never the SDK
directly (the same discipline as `fetchWithToken`). The split in one line: **metadata →
`fetchWithToken` (backend); bytes → `shared/lib/storage.ts` (Storage).**

### `modules/`
This is where business domains live.

Each module is a self-contained area of the product.

Main activities:
- Hold domain-specific UI and logic
- Keep feature-specific data flow contained
- Expose a clean public API to the rest of the app
- Prevent unrelated code from reaching inside the module

Example modules:
- `auth` for sign in, sign up, session handling
- `catalog` for listing, filtering, and viewing products
- `orders` for checkout, order history, and order details
- `billing` for payment and invoices
- `analytics` for charts, reports, and dashboards

### `pages/` inside a module
This is the route-level composition area inside a module.

Main activities:
- Assemble widgets and features into a screen
- Connect page data requirements to child blocks
- Keep route-specific composition, not deep business logic

Example:
- `orders/pages/order-details`
- `catalog/pages/catalog-home`

### `widgets/` inside a module
These are medium-to-large UI blocks built from smaller pieces.

Main activities:
- Combine multiple features and entities into one section of a screen
- Reuse on more than one page when possible
- Keep layout and screen composition manageable

A widget that grows complex enough to have its own private sub-components should become a folder with a `components/` subfolder:

```txt
widgets/
  ChatTranscript/
    index.ts              ← public API, only export exposed here
    ChatTranscript.tsx    ← the widget itself
    components/
      ChatMessage.tsx     ← private, only used by ChatTranscript
      TypingIndicator.tsx
      ScrollToBottom.tsx
```

- `components/` inside a widget is private — nothing outside the widget folder should import from it directly.
- The widget's `index.ts` is the only public entry point.
- Simple widgets with no sub-components remain as a single file (no folder needed).

Example:
- `orders/widgets/order-summary`
- `catalog/widgets/product-grid`

### `features/` inside a module
These are user-facing actions or workflows.

Main activities:
- Handle one business action
- Coordinate forms, validation, state, and API calls
- Emit events or callbacks to the surrounding UI

Example:
- `auth/features/login`
- `orders/features/cancel-order`
- `catalog/features/add-to-cart`

### `entities/` inside a module
These define the business objects and their local behavior.

Main activities:
- Store entity types and models
- Keep domain rules close to the concept
- Provide entity-specific selectors, formatters, and adapters
- Expose simple helpers that other layers can consume

Example:
- `orders/entities/order`
- `catalog/entities/product`
- `auth/entities/user`

### `shared/` inside a module
Use this only for code that is reusable within that module but not meant for the whole app.

Main activities:
- Module-specific helpers
- Module-specific UI fragments
- Small reusable utilities that support that module only

If something becomes useful across multiple modules, move it to root `shared/`.

## Fast Refresh file rules

Vite's Fast Refresh requires every file to export **only one kind of thing**. Mixing kinds in a single file breaks hot reload.

| What the file exports | Extension | Naming |
|---|---|---|
| React components only | `.tsx` | `PascalCase.tsx` |
| Hooks only | `.ts` | `useSomething.ts` |
| Context object + types (no component, no hook) | `.ts` | `camelCase.ts` |
| Utilities / constants | `.ts` | `camelCase.ts` |

Rules:
- **Never export a hook from a component file.** If a `.tsx` file has a component, move any `use...` functions out to their own `.ts` file.
- **Never put a context object in the same file as the provider component.** Create a separate `camelCase.ts` for the context (e.g. `authContext.ts`) and a `PascalCase.tsx` for the provider (e.g. `AuthProvider.tsx`). Both import from the context file; neither imports from the other.
- Barrel `index.ts` files are exempt — they only re-export and are not processed by Fast Refresh.

## Dependency Rules

- `app` can depend on `shared` and modules.
- Modules can depend on `shared`.
- A module should avoid importing the private internals of another module.
- If another module needs something, expose it through a public API file.
- UI primitives should not import business logic.
- Business logic should not depend on page composition.

## Practical Division of Responsibility

### UI layer
Handles:
- Rendering
- Styling
- Layout
- Basic interaction feedback
- Passing events upward

Should not handle:
- Complex business decisions
- Cross-module workflows
- Server orchestration logic

### Logic layer
Handles:
- Validation
- API requests
- Workflow state
- Business rules
- Data transformation

Should not handle:
- Page layout decisions
- Styling details
- Presentational concerns

## Example Flow

For an order details screen:

- `pages/order-details` loads the screen.
- `widgets/order-header` shows the top summary.
- `entities/order` provides the order model and formatting.
- `features/cancel-order` handles the cancel action.
- `shared/ui/button` provides the button component.

This keeps the screen clear and keeps logic in the right place.

## When to Move Code

Move code to a more specific folder when:
- A component is used only inside one business area.
- A function starts carrying domain rules.
- A shared utility starts depending on business data.
- A page becomes too large and starts mixing concerns.

## What Success Looks Like

A good frontend architecture should let you answer these questions quickly:
- Which business module owns this code?
- Is this UI or logic?
- Is this reusable across the app or only inside one module?
- Can another developer find the right file without guessing?

If the answer is clear, the structure is working.

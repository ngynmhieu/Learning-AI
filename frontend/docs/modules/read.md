# Read Module — Architecture (manga reader, displayed as "Lector")

> Per-module doc for the manga-reader frontend. Code-level module name: **`read`**
> (`modules/read/`). **"Lector"** is the user-facing label only — the sidebar nav
> text and page headings — never a folder name. Pairs with `backend/docs/modules/read.md`
> and `supabase/docs/modules/read.md`. Read `frontend_guidelines.md` first, including
> its networking section (the new `shared/lib/storage.ts` wrapper).

## Status

**Proposal.** Agreed design, not yet built.

## Overview

A manga library: browse all series, open one to see its **Volumes** / **Chapters**
tabs, build a volume/chapter by uploading local images or scraping a site, and read it
in a fast, modern reader. It also has an **image pool** — a personal staging area where
you collect scraped or uploaded images (across many sessions) that aren't tied to any
manga yet, then organize them into a volume/chapter later. The defining choice (see the
guidelines): **image bytes go frontend ↔ Supabase Storage directly**; the backend owns
only metadata (what exists, who owns it, page order).

        useSignedPages.ts            ← batch-sign a section's pages for the reader
```

> Endpoint callers live **in the module** (`modules/read/shared/api/read.ts`), not
> `shared/api/`, because only this module uses them (per the api-vs-module rule). They
> cover **metadata only** — the image bytes never go through these callers.

## Routing

Three routes under the existing `ProtectedRoute → AppLayout` children. The paths use
the **display** name `/lector/*` (user-facing), while the code lives in `modules/read`:

```
/lector                              → MangaCollectionPage
/lector/manga/:mangaId               → MangaSectionsPage   (tabs read ?tab=volumes|chapters)
/lector/manga/:mangaId/read/:sectionId → MangaReaderPage
/lector/pool                         → LibraryPage          (the unassigned image pool)
```

A `MangaCollectionProvider` (the manga collection, mirroring `ConversationsProvider`) wraps
these so the grid and detail page share one source of truth. One new sidebar nav item,
labelled **"Lector"**, points at `/lector` (added in `app/layouts/Sidebar/navItems.ts`).

## The two upload flows

### Local upload — direct to Storage
1. Open a section (or create one via `create-section`).
2. `UploadTray`: pick local images, **drag to reorder** — this staging order is the
   page order. Dimensions are read client-side (`Image`/`createImageBitmap`) for the
   `width/height` metadata.
3. `upload-pages` uploads each file **straight to Storage** via
   `shared/lib/storage.ts → uploadToBucket`, to
   `manga/{userId}/{mangaId}/{sectionId}/{position}-{uuid}.{ext}` — parallel, no
   backend round-trip for bytes. RLS lets a user write only under their own prefix.
4. Once uploaded, `POST /read/sections/{id}/pages` records the ordered rows
   `[{storage_path, position, width, height}]`.

### Scrape — pick from a site
1. `ScrapePicker`: paste a URL → `scrape-pages` calls `POST /read/scrape {url}`.
2. Backend returns candidate image URLs; the picker shows them as a selectable,
   reorderable grid.
3. `import-pages` sends the chosen, ordered URLs to
   `POST /read/sections/{id}/import` — the **backend** downloads + uploads them
   (browsers can't fetch cross-origin/hotlink-protected images) and records the rows.
4. The picker then refetches the section's pages.

> Both upload flows have a **"send to pool"** variant when you don't yet know which
> manga the images belong to — see *The image pool* below. `ScrapePicker` and
> `UploadTray` are reused there; only the destination endpoint differs.

## The image pool (staging)

`/lector/pool` (`LibraryPage` + `PoolGrid`) is a personal, manga-less collection you fill
over time, then drain into series when you're ready. It exists because scraping and
uploading often happen *before* you've decided the target volume/chapter — you gather
first, organize later.

**Filling the library** (`collect-to-library`):
- *Scrape → pool:* same `ScrapePicker` candidate flow, but the chosen URLs go to
  `POST /read/library/import` (backend downloads → `{userId}/_pool/…` → records
  `library_assets`). You can repeat this across many sessions; assets accumulate.
- *Upload → pool:* same `UploadTray`, uploading straight to `{userId}/_pool/…` via
  `shared/lib/storage.ts`, then `POST /read/library` records the rows.

**Draining the library** (`organize-from-library`):
1. `PoolGrid` shows the pool (assets resolved to previews via batch signed URLs, like
   the reader) and lets you **select + drag-order** the ones for a section.
2. Pick a target manga + volume/chapter (or create one), then
   `POST /read/sections/{id}/pages/from-library` with the ordered `asset_ids`.
3. The backend turns each into a `manga_page` (reusing the same Storage object — no
   re-upload) and removes it from the pool. The organized assets **disappear from the
   pool grid** and appear as the section's pages — your "gets a manga link, leaves the
   pool."

**Discarding**: an unused asset can be deleted (`DELETE /read/library/{id}`), which
removes both the row and its Storage file.

## Reading — fast & modern

`MangaReaderPage` loads ordered metadata via `GET /read/sections/{id}/pages`, then
`useSignedPages` **batch-signs** all of that section's `storage_path`s in one
`createSignedUrls` call (private bucket → temporary CDN links, ~1h TTL). The `Reader`
widget then:
- Renders a **virtualized** vertical scroll (only on-screen pages mounted).
- **Preloads** the next page(s) ahead of the viewport.
- Reserves each page's box from the stored `width/height` → **no layout shift**.
- Uses `loading="lazy"` and an IntersectionObserver to track progress.

Because images load directly from the Storage CDN (not proxied through FastAPI), the
reader stays fast even for large volumes.

## `shared/lib/storage.ts` (new shared infra)

A thin supabase-js wrapper so features never touch the raw client (mirrors how
`fetchWithToken` centralizes the token):

```ts
uploadToBucket(path: string, file: Blob): Promise<void>          // storage.from(MANGA_BUCKET).upload(...)
createSignedUrls(paths: string[], expiresIn?: number): Promise<string[]>
```

It reads the same authenticated Supabase session the rest of the app uses, so Storage
RLS sees the logged-in user. This is the one sanctioned place to use the Supabase
client for Storage — features/entities call this, not the SDK directly.

## Entities

- `manga` — `Manga` (`id, title, coverPath, updatedAt`), the library list provider.
- `section` — `Section` (`id, mangaId, kind: "volume"|"chapter", number, title`).
- `page` — `Page` (`id, storagePath, position, width, height`) + reader progress state.
- `library-asset` — `LibraryAsset` (`id, storagePath, sourceUrl, width, height,
  createdAt`) + the pool list provider (newest-first; no `position` — order is chosen
  at organize time).

## Design notes

- All colors via `--owl-*` CSS variables; proportional units only (per guidelines).
- The library grid and reader are media-heavy → covers use thumbnails (future) and the
  reader virtualizes; never render a whole volume's `<img>`s at once.
- Metadata reads/writes go through `fetchWithToken` (backend); **bytes** go through
  `shared/lib/storage.ts` (Storage). Two paths, by design — see the guidelines.
